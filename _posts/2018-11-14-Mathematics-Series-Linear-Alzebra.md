Visisble change 
Machine learning is one of the most hot topics right now. But before diving into this topic we need proficiency in some major topics in mathematcis i.e. Probability, Information Theory, Linear Alzebra, Diffrentiation and Integration. 

I will be discussing Linear Alzebra in this blog. I will also write a blog about the remaining topics in the upcoming blog so please stay tuned.

# Linear Alzebra
A good understanding of linear alzebra in essential for understanding and working with many machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning algorithms.

Content:
1. Terminology
2. Assumption-
      Multiplying Matrix and Vectors
      Identity and Inverse Matrix
      Norms
      Deteminant    
 3. Linear Dependence Span
 4. Special Kind of Matricses
 5. Trace Operator
 

## Terminology 
1. Scalar - A scalar is just a single number.
I will be writing Scalar in Italic lower-case letter in italics. For example

Scalar $$\mathit{s}

2. Vector - A Vecor is an array of numbers.
I will write them in  Bold lower case letter. For example

Vector $$\mathbf{v}
